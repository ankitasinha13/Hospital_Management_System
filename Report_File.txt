INTRODUCTION

The Hospital Management System is a database management system designed to
store and manage information related to hospital operations. It helps in maintaining
records of patients, doctors, appointments, wards and medicines efficiently.
This system ensures proper tracking of patient details, doctors, consultations, ward
admissions, and prescribed medicines. It reduces manual work and improves
accuracy, consistency, and security of data.
The system uses relational database and an Entity Relationship (ER) model to design
and organize the database

Objective of the Project
• To store patient information
• To maintain doctor details
• To manage appointment records
• To store ward admission details
• To maintain medicine records
• To maintain relationships between all entities

Entity Description
1. Patient Entity
This stores the information about the patient.
Attributes:
• patient_id (Primary Key)
• patient_name
• age
• gender
• contact_number

2. Doctor Entity
This entity stores the information about doctors.
Attributes:
• doctor_id (Primary Key)
• doctor_name
• specialization
• experience
• contact_number

3. Appointment Entity
This stores the information about the appointment between the patient and
doctor.
Attributes:
• appointment_id (Primary Key)

• appointment_date

4. Ward Entity
This stores the information about ward in which patient is alloted to go.
Attributes:

5. Medicine Entity
This stores the information of medicines which are prescribed by the doctor
to patient,
Attributes:

Relationship: One-to-Many
One patient can book many appointments and each appointment can
belong to only one patient.
Participation:
- Appointment : Total participation
- Patient : Partial participation

2. Patient CONSULTED_BY Doctor
Relationship: Many-to-Many
One patient can be consulted by many doctors and one doctor can consult
many patients.
Participation:

3. Patient ASSIGNED_TO Ward
Relationship: Many-to-One
One ward can have many patients and one patient is assigned to only one
ward at a time.

Participation:
- Patient : Total participation
- Ward : Partial participation

4. Doctor PRESCRIBES Medicine
Relationship: Many-to-Many
One doctor can prescribe many medicines and one medicine can be
prescribed to many doctors.
-Doctor : Partial participation

5. Patient PURCHASES Medicine
Relationship: Many-to-Many
One patient can take many medicines, also one medicine can be
purchased by many patients.
-Patient : Total participation
-Medicine : Partial participation

Relational Schema
1. Patient (patient_id, patient_name, age, gender, contact_number)
2.Doctor (doctor_id, doctor_name, specialization, experience,
contact_number)
3. Appointment (appointment_id, appointment_date, status, patient_id,
doctor_id)
4. Ward (ward_id, ward_name, ward_type, capacity, patient_id)
5. Medicine (medicine_id, medicine_name, dosage, price, patient_id)

Primary keys and Foreign keys

Primary Key :
• patient_id
• doctor_id
• appointment_id
• ward_id
• medicine_id

Foreign Key:
• appointment.patient_id → patient.patient_id
• appointment.doctor_id → doctor.doctor_id

• ward.patient_id → patient.patient_id
• medicine.patient_id → patient.patient_id

CONCLUSION

The Hospital Management System provides an efficient way to manage
hospital data. It maintains patient records, doctor information,
appointments, ward details, and medicines.
This system improves efficiency, reduces errors, and ensures proper data
management.
